# Ames Housing Feature Engineering Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed feature engineering on the Ames Housing Dataset to develop new variables that could enhance the predictive performance of the model. Going beyond basic transformations, I engineered three unique features aimed at capturing complex relationships within the data. The engineered features were designed to potentially have significant correlative effects on the housing price, adding unique perspectives and practical value for real estate analysis.

The analysis focused on:
- Understanding the correlation between each new feature and the target variable.
- Providing a practical real-world justification for each feature.
- Assessing the performance of these features through correlation matrices and interpretation.

This project demonstrates my capability in data preprocessing, feature creation, and analysis to improve predictive modeling for structured datasets.
